This is simple thread library which can create, delete, suspend, resume, run &sleep threads. It can also show the status of any thread.
Threads  can be created with or without function arguments. It simply stores the TCB value of the thread and run it. To run please follow the following commands:-(Note:- only tested on ubuntu).
1) gcc -c MyThread.c
2) gcc -c Yourprogram.c
3) gcc MyThread.o Yourprogram.o -o executable
4) ./executable


Donâ€™t forget to include MyThread.h
